                            Growing up as a nomad in eastern Mongolia, Bayarjavkhlan (Jack) Bayanmunkh experienced the scarcity of 
                            educational resources and guidance. Motivated by this experience, he co-founded Gobi Scholars to create a supportive 
                            community of scholars committed to shaping Mongolia's future. Gobi Scholars connects ambitious Mongolian students 
                            with top U.S. colleges and offers opportunities for U.S. students to teach in Mongolia, 
                            bridging global knowledge with local needs. In addition to empowering students, 
                            we organize educational forums to engage policymakers, raise awareness about the challenges facing Mongolia's 
                            education system, and advocate for meaningful reforms. By uniting students, educators, and policymakers, 
                            Gobi Scholars is dedicated to building a stronger, more innovative education system for Mongolia's future.

                            You can find me debating with anyone on anything during my free time and if I am not debating 
                            then I am probably reading some manga while debating with myself inside my head.

                            is large quantities of food. If you meet me, we will debate and that is a fact.<br>`,
