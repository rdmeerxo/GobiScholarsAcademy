                        then I am probably reading some manga while debating with myself inside my head. 
                        To relax, I like to compete with people or make some cosplay using EVA foam. My favorite food 
                        is large quantities of food. If you meet me, we will debate and that is a fact.<br>`,

        description: `Tansagmergen Terbish is a passionate urban planning enthusiast and aspiring environmental engineer dedicated to creating sustainable, 
        inclusive communities. His vision focuses on addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization, particularly in Mongolia, by integrating innovative 
        planning strategies and environmental solutions. During his internship at the Ministry of Urban Development and Construction, he worked on urban 
        projects addressing infrastructure and housing issues, gaining invaluable insight into policy-making and city planning.<br><br>

        Beyond his urban planning interests, Tansagmergen has contributed extensively to environmental and social causes. With over 700 volunteer hours at 
        Lantuun Dohio and other NGOs, he has raised over $21,000 for three impactful environmental projects. His thrift campaign (Gargen1101), 
        successfully sold 800 items, saving an estimated 20,430,000 liters of water. What began as a sustainability initiative has now evolved into one of 
        his own thriving businesses. His research on urbanization, published in Bloomberg Mongolia, delves into the effects of rapid urban growth on housing 
        and infrastructure, offering innovative strategies to improve urban sustainability and living conditions. This work demonstrates his ability to merge 
        analytical research with actionable solutions, making a meaningful contribution to Mongolia's urban discourse.<br><br>
        
        Tansagmergen’s diverse experiences reflect his adaptability and leadership. As an international scout teacher, he has fostered teamwork and resilience 
        among youth. During his exchange year in Denver, Colorado with the Zorig Foundation, he embraced global perspectives, further shaping his vision of a 
        collaborative, sustainable future.<br><br>

        <strong>Message:</strong>  Hi, I’m Tansagaa, a kid from Bayankhongor, Baatsagaan, and a graduate of 52nd Secondary School and I took gap year. 
        Currently my goal is to work in urban planning, environmental engineering, or industry in future. I’m an ENFP/ENFJ who loves video editing, 
        photography, and martial arts—especially judo, drawing and poetry. I’m not one to brag, so I’ll keep it brief! I love balancing between academics 
        and activities cuz you can talk to whatever you want; I’m incredibly talkative.`,
