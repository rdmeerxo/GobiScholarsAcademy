                            You can find me debating with anyone on anything during my free time and

                            To relax, I like to compete with people or make some cosplay using EVA foam. 
                            My favorite food is large quantities of food. If you meet me, we will debate and that is a fact.</span>

                        I love meeting new people and exploring diverse cultures, and I'm particularly interested in the political systems of China, 
                        the USA, Russia, and Mongolia. My internships with Mongolia's People's Party and Democratic Party
                         have enriched my understanding of politics, though I align more with the Democratic Party. 
                         My goal is to help create a world where everyone feels accepted and valued. 
                         I believe in learning from historical ideologies like Leninism and Maoism to adopt successful strategies for development, 
                         as China has done. While I hold strong views, I'm committed to listening and growing through others' experiences.

                         (my intended majors actually). I spent much of my time organizing youth-led programs, 
                         advocating for climate action, and even renovating schools with hundreds of volunteers. 
                         If you’re down for deep convos over coffee or a hike to clear the mind, let’s connect!

                      <span class="full-info hidden">Hi everyone! I'm a rising senior at NBIS with a passion for politics and social justice, focusing on women's rights and disability issues. 
                        I love meeting new people and exploring diverse cultures, and I'm particularly interested in the political systems of China, 
                        the USA, Russia, and Mongolia. My internships with Mongolia's People's Party and Democratic Party
                         have enriched my understanding of politics, though I align more with the Democratic Party. 
                         My goal is to help create a world where everyone feels accepted and valued. 
                         I believe in learning from historical ideologies like Leninism and Maoism to adopt successful strategies for development, 
                         as China has done. While I hold strong views, I'm committed to listening and growing through others' experiences.
